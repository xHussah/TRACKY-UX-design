# TRACKY (UX/UI design)

This project was completed in May 2024 as part of a school group assignment, with four students (including myself) collaborating on it.

Throughout the process, we learned the principles of user experience design. We began by conducting interviews and distributing surveys to understand our audienceâ€™s needs. Then, we created personas and user stories, followed by sketches, storyboards, and user flow diagrams. Before moving to Figma, we evaluated our initial sketches and user flows to refine our ideas.

After completing the Figma prototype, we shared it with external participants, observed the time they took to complete assigned tasks, and gathered their feedback and recommendations.

Finally, we wrapped up the project by preparing the presentation, poster, and a trailer, which we uploaded to YouTube.
